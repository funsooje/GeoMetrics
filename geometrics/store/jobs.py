"""
Job tracking: submit records, status polling, and GEE task expiry handling.

GEE task lifecycle:
  READY → RUNNING → COMPLETED | FAILED | CANCELLED

GEE deletes tasks from its records after ~30 days (or on manual deletion).
When a task can no longer be found in GEE:
  - If local status was COMPLETED → file is already in Drive; status unchanged.
  - If local status was PENDING or RUNNING → job never finished; marked EXPIRED.
  - EXPIRED jobs should be resubmitted.
